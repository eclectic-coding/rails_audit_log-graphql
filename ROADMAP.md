# Roadmap

This gem adds a GraphQL API layer on top of [`rails_audit_log`](https://github.com/eclectic-coding/rails_audit_log). It is intentionally a separate gem so that `graphql-ruby` remains an optional dependency for host applications.

---

## 0.2.0 — Filtering & Connections

- **`touching:` filter** — narrow results to entries that changed a specific attribute
- **Sorting** — `orderBy: { field: CREATED_AT, direction: DESC }`

---

## 0.3.0 — Actor & Resource Resolver Types

- **`ActorType`** — resolve the polymorphic `actor` to the concrete type in the host app's schema (requires a configurable type resolver proc)
- **`AuditedResourceType`** — resolve `item_type`/`item_id` to the concrete audited model type
- **`diffType`** — structured `{ from, to }` diff type instead of raw `objectChanges` JSON

---

## 0.4.0 — Subscriptions

Requires Action Cable in the host application.

- **`auditLogEntryCreated(itemType:, itemId:)`** — subscribe to new entries for a specific record
- **`auditLogEntryCreated(actorId:)`** — subscribe to all entries by a specific actor
- Hooks into `RailsAuditLog::Streaming::NotificationsAdapter` to trigger broadcasts

---

## 0.5.0 — Multi-tenancy & Advanced Filtering

- **Tenant scoping** — automatically scope queries via `RailsAuditLog.current_tenant` when configured
- **`forTenant:` argument** — explicit tenant filter on `auditLogEntries`
- **Aggregations** — `auditLogEntriesCount(event:, itemType:, since:)` for dashboard metrics

---

## 0.6.0 — Performance & Safety

- **Dataloader batch loading** — batch-resolve polymorphic `actor` and `item` associations using graphql-ruby's `dataloader` to eliminate N+1 queries on list responses
- **`auditLogReify` query** — `auditLogReify(itemType:, itemId:, at:)` returns the reconstructed object state as JSON at a given point in time, backed by `RailsAuditLog.version_at`
- **Query complexity & depth limits** — built-in defaults (`max_complexity`, `max_depth`) with a config override (`RailsAuditLogGraphql.max_complexity = 200`) to protect against expensive queries before the API is declared stable
- **`AuditLogJsonScalar`** — proper JSON scalar type for `objectChanges` and `metadata` fields, replacing opaque String serialization and making the schema self-documenting

---

## 1.0.0 — Stable API

- Full YARD documentation
- **RSpec matchers** — `expect(response).to have_graphql_audit_entry(:update).touching(:title)` 
- **Minitest assertions** — `assert_graphql_audit_entry`
- API stability guarantee — no breaking changes without a major version bump
- Complete README with setup guide, examples, and schema reference
